# HTB_Writeups

## Contributing

If you're a member of our team and would like to add your own writeup into a CTF's folder, create an additional file with the name of the challenge you worked on and its category. For example, the writeup for a crypto challenge called "CryptAllThings" would be in a file named `crypto_CryptAllThings`. In case a writeup already exists for your challenge, append a `_2` (or an increment of that) to your filename.
